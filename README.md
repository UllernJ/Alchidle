# Idle game

## Todo

- Invent new resource.

- More research

- 50 50 chance of who attacks first

- Bosses? extra maps? rewards?
- Fix balancing, things should stagnate
- When things stagnate the player should do some sort of reborn (restart the game with extra perks)
- Design perks

## Somewhat finished

- Fix session storage (its shit rn)
- Handle insane big numbers -> CHECK OUT ARRAY HANDLING

- Infusions (add more info and make them more useful)

- Punish player if dies -> lose resources or gear? (REJECTED)

- Money is too OP, a player will always focus money

- Make combat more balanced (based on feedback, looks to be somewhat balanced)
