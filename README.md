# Idle game

## Todo

- Infusions (add more info and make them more useful)

- Rework alchemy, invent new resource.

- More research (Some shit should be the same research with some form of count, multiplier

- Handle insane big numbers -> CHECK OUT ARRAY HANDLING

- 50 50 chance of who attacks first

- Fix session storage (its shit rn)

## Somewhat finished

- Punish player if dies -> lose resources or gear?

- Money is too OP, a player will always focus money

- Make combat more balanced (based on feedback, looks to be somewhat balanced)
