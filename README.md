# Idle game

## Todo

- Make combat more balanced

- Infusions
- Should Alchemy be a resource or only workers?

- More research

- Handle insane big numbers -> CHECK OUT ARRAY HANDLING

- 50 50 chance of who attacks first

- Fix session storage (its shit rn)

## Somewhat finished

- Punish player if dies -> lose resources or gear?

- Money is too OP, a player will always focus money
